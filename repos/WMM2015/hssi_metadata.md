WMM2015 World Magnetic Model...in simple, object-oriented Python. WMM2015 is a Python wrapper for the World Magnetic Model 2015, providing a simple interface to compute geomagnetic field components (north, east, down, total intensity, declination, and inclination) at specified geographic coordinates and altitudes. The package uses a build-on-run technique, compiling the C library on first use. Tested on Linux, Mac and Windows. Most C compilers work.

## Section 2: Additional Data

### 16. Keywords (OPTIONAL)
- geomagnetism
- geomagnetic
- World Magnetic Model
- magnetic field
- build-on-run
- ionosphere_thermosphere_mesosphere (from PyHC)
- specific (from PyHC)

**Source:** setup.cfg, GitHub topics via SoMEF, PyHC registry

### 17. Data Sources (OPTIONAL)
Not found

**Note:** The software uses built-in WMM2015 coefficient data files, not external data sources

### 18. Input File Formats (RECOMMENDED)
- ascii

**Note:** The primary Python API takes numerical inputs (lat, lon, altitude, year) programmatically. The bundled C file-processing program accepts ASCII input files, and the repository includes `src/wmm2015/test_input.asc`.

### 19. Output File Formats (RECOMMENDED)
- ascii

**Note:** The primary Python API returns xarray.Dataset objects in memory. The bundled C file-processing program writes ASCII output files.

### 20. Operating System (RECOMMENDED)
- Linux
- Mac
- Windows

**Source:** README.md, .github/workflows/ci.yml (CI testing on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest)

### 21. CPU Architecture (RECOMMENDED)
- CPU Independent

**Source:** Inferred from Python package compatibility and lack of documented architecture-specific constraints.

### 22. Related Phenomena (OPTIONAL)
Not found

**Note:** While the software models geomagnetic phenomena, specific phenomena terms from controlled vocabularies were not found in repository documentation

### 23. Development Status (RECOMMENDED)
Inactive

**Source:** setup.cfg classifier indicates production/stable status, but the latest local commit is from 2021-10-10 and the latest tag is v1.1.1 from 2021-02-11, so there is no clear evidence of ongoing active development.

### 24. Documentation (RECOMMENDED)
https://github.com/space-physics/wmm2015

**Source:** setup.cfg url field
**Note:** Documentation is primarily in the README.md file in the repository; no separate documentation site found

### 25. Funder (OPTIONAL)
Not found

### 26. Award Title (OPTIONAL)
Not found
