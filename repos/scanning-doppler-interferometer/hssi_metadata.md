### 8. Description (MANDATORY)
Load, parse, and plot Scanning Doppler Interferometer data from PI Mark Conde's instruments. This software package loads and plots scanning Doppler interferometer data, particularly focused on atmospheric wind measurements. The package supports reading both ASCII text files and IDL .sav files containing wind data (zonal, meridional, and vertical components with associated uncertainties) from Scanning Doppler Interferometer observations. The data is aligned geographically at the station location and includes time series measurements of wind speeds in meters per second.
