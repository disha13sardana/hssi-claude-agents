### 8. Description (MANDATORY)
**Description:** Rees-Sergienko-Ivanov model of excitation rates, relevant to auroral optical emissions. This physics-based model simulates auroral electron precipitation and ionization processes in Earth's ionosphere. The model is designed for electron energies in the range of 100-10,000 eV and uses the MSISE-00 atmospheric model to generate O, O₂, and N₂ densities. It calculates the ionization profiles and volume emission rates as a function of altitude resulting from primary electron precipitation on the neutral atmospheric background. The model is based on work by Gustavsson and Brandström (AIDA_TOOLS) and implements the approach described in Sergienko and Ivanov (1993).
